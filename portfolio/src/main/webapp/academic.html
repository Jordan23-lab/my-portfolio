                <p>This is by far one of my proudest achievements yet. I went to Bard High School Early College Queens and this school 
                    is a very accelerated high school in which everyone completes their high school classes in 2 years and the last 2 
                    years are spent taking college classes, by the conclusion of the program we graduated with an associates degree 
                    and a high school diploma.</p>

                <p>I worked in a team of 4 people and we were tasked to build a robot from scratch 
                    with the Snappy XO kit the professor gave to us. I did all of the programming 
                    for the robot using an arduino uno microcontroller. I controlled the motors and 
                    the sensors to program the robot to perform its tasks.</p>
