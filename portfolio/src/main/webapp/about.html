      <h1>About Me</h1>
      
      <p>My name is Jordan Drummond, I am 19 years old and I grew up in The Bronx, NY. My middle school always 
          used to have career day. I had a true passion for sports so usually I will come in as either 
          a professional soccer or baseball player. But I realized that the chances of becoming a pro athlete are very rare. So in 7th grade I wanted to be something different. 
          I asked my dad for advice, he said “You should look to do something that you are good at or that you enjoy doing, or doing something where you can get the best results while doing the least amount of work.” 
        I always enjoyed my math and science courses ever since elementary school (except for biology). 
        They were subjects I excelled at, while putting the least amount of effort in. But in 10th grade after 
        taking physics, I realized that I wanted my career to revolve around math and physics. Ever since then, I’ve been taking some of the most challenging STEM courses in my school. 
        I became a peer tutor for Algebra 2 and Trigonometry, at my school, and I just generally enjoyed solving challenging math and physics programs. Unfortunately, I still do not know what exactly in STEM I want to do. 
        I decided to enter Stony Brook as a mechanical engineering major, but I quickly realized 
        my passion for coding when I had to build a robot for my final project. I found myself more interested 
        in programming the robot than designing and building it. I then took intro programming and  probability and statistics the next semester and I really enjoyed both so I decided to
        major in Applied  Mathematics and Statistics where I can use programming as a tool to solve complex real world mathematical problems.</p>
