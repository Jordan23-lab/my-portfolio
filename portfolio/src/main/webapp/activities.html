                <p>I first started playing soccer in middle school. I used to dislike the sport and mainly played because my dad forced me to, 
                but after a few years I started to get good at the sport I started to enjoy it. I continued playing throughout high school eventually becoming captain of 
                my varsity soccer team and getting recruited to play for some college teams. I chose not to play 
                in college, but I do play in the soccer club at Stony Brook.</p>

                <img src="/images/BardTrackTeam.JPG", style="width:100%">
                <p>I decided to try track in my junior year of high school just because all my friends were part of it. I did not regret my decision to join at all. 
                Going to meets has been some of the highlights in high school and my senior 
                year I was 0.2 seconds away from the school record for the 100m and the 200m</p>

                <img src="/images/StMartin2.JPG", style="width:100%">
                <p>I love to travel to new places and experience different cultures and see what life is like outside of my hometown. I am really fortunate that I had the opportunity to be able to go to countries like Spain, Jamaica, 
                and even to places across the U.S like Los Angeles.</p>

        <h2>Music</h2>
         <iframe width="420", height="345", src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_9q4O3Tgxg"></iframe>
         <p>I really enjoy music and music thoery. I took my first music class back in my freshman year of high school and I just really loved analyzing how songs are made up and how I can apply it to composing my own music. 
             I composed this as my final project for my music composition class.</p>
