      <h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>
      
      <p>Hello, my name is Jordan Drummond and welcome to my digital portfolio. On this site you can learn more about me, 
          my academic achievements, extracurriculars and my current resume. I am a junior at Stony Brook University and 
          I am currently majoring in Applied Mathematics and Statistics and I plan on going to graduate school for 
          computer science after to expand on my programming skills that I have learned in my undergraduate curriculum 
          with the hopes of becoming a data scientist or a machine learning engineer. I originally came to Stony Brook 
          wanting to become a mechanical engineer, but after programming a robot I realized that I had a passion for programming. 
          I decided to take a programming class and more advanced math classes and I decided to major in applied mathematics and 
          statistics to use programming as a tool to solve complex real world mathematical problems. I confirmed this interest after 
          doing undergraduate research in computational geometry. I would like to thank my professor that I am doing research with to 
          find out what it is that I truly want to do. 
        
          If you would like to learn more information about me, feel free to check out the rest of the site. 
          To navigate through the site click the headers at the top of the screen to take you to the corresponding web pages. I have 
          included information about my hobbies and interests, extracurriculars, academic achievements and projects. I hope you enjoy 
          learning more about me and my accomplishments. </p>
