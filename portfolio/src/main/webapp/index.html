      <h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>
      
      <p>Hello, my name is Jordan Drummond and welcome to my digital portfolio. On this site you can learn more about me, 
          my academic achievements, extracurriculars and my current resume. I am a junior at Stony Brook University and I am 
          currently majoring in Applied Mathematics and Statistics and I plan on going to graduate school for computer science after to expand on my programming skills that 
          I have learned in my undergraduate curriculum with the hopes of becoming a data scientist or a machine learning engineer. I originally came to Stony Brook wanting to become 
          a mechanical engineer, but after programming a robot I realized that I had a passion for programming. I decided to take a programming class and more advanced math classes 
          and I decided to major in applied mathematics and statistics to use programming as a tool to solve complex real world 
          mathematical problems.</p>
      
      
       
      
    
       <h2>Project:</h2>
       <p>This is a robot design project that I made freshman year while
           I was a mechanical engineering major. I was the programmer for the project,
           so I was tasked with programming the motors and sensors 
           for the robot.</p>
